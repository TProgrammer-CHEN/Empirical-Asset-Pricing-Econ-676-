# Empirical-Asset-Pricing-Econ-676
This respository contains all the matlab codes I wrote for Duke Empirical Asset Pricing Courses(Econ 676).
The PS1 analyzes the Mean, Standard deviations, and other fundamental properties of given financial data.
The PS2 contains efficient frontier analysis, robustness test, and simulations with normal distribution and empirical distribution.
